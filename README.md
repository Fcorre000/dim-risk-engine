## The Problem

FedEx charges by **dimensional (DIM) weight** when a package's volume-to-weight ratio exceeds a threshold — often resulting in shipping costs far above what actual weight alone would suggest. For high-volume shippers, this creates significant and largely *avoidable* costs.

DimRisk Engine takes a FedEx invoice export and runs it through two trained XGBoost models to answer two questions for every shipment:

1. **Should this package have been DIM-flagged?** — Surfaces cases where FedEx charged DIM but the model predicts it shouldn't have been (dispute candidates)
2. **Is the charge reasonable?** — Flags shipments where the actual cost exceeds the model's prediction by more than 25% (overcharge candidates)

---

## How It Works

                        └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

The backend streams results as **NDJSON** (newline-delimited JSON) so the frontend can render a live progress bar and begin displaying data before the full file is processed. A 50,000-row invoice streams in seconds.

## ML Models

The XGBoost models powering this dashboard were trained on **53,000 real FedEx shipments** from a mattress manufacturing company. Full training code, EDA notebooks, and model evaluation are in the companion repository:

**[Fcorre000/shipping-dim-xgboost-pytorch](https://github.com/Fcorre000/shipping-dim-xgboost-pytorch)**

### Model Details

| Model | Task | Input | Output |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| `xgb_classifier.pkl` | Binary classification | 34 engineered features | P(DIM=Y) — probability the shipment should be DIM-flagged |
| `xgb_regressor.pkl` | Regression | 34 engineered features | Predicted net charge in log-space (converted to dollars via `np.expm1()`) |

### Anomaly Detection Logic

- **DIM anomaly ("Unexpected")**: Model predicts P(DIM=N) > 0.6 but FedEx charged DIM=Y — the shipment likely shouldn't have been DIM-billed. These are dispute candidates.
- **Cost anomaly ("Review")**: Actual charge exceeds `predicted_net_charge_high` (the 95th-percentile upper bound of the 90% prediction interval) — potential overcharge worth investigating.

### Feature Engineering Highlights

- 34 features derived from raw invoice columns: package dimensions, weight, volume, DIM weight ratio, service type (one-hot), pay type (one-hot), pricing zone (normalized)
- Leakage prevention: `Shipment Rated Weight` and `Net Charge Billed Currency` are excluded from model input
- Pricing zone normalization: single-digit zones zero-padded (`'2'` -> `'02'`), non-standard values mapped to `'Other'`

## Streaming Architecture

Traditional upload-then-wait APIs block the UI until the entire file is processed. DimRisk Engine uses a **chunked streaming architecture** instead:

1. **Backend** reads the file into memory, estimates total row count, then streams an NDJSON response:
   - First line: `{"__meta__": true, "total": 50000}` (row count for progress tracking)
   - Subsequent lines: one `ShipmentResult` JSON object per row
   - File is parsed in 1000-row chunks via a Python generator

2. **Frontend** consumes the stream via the `ReadableStream` API:
   - Progress bar fills proportionally as rows arrive
   - Shimmer animation indicates active processing
   - Results render incrementally (batched every 200 rows for performance)
   - `requestAnimationFrame` yields ensure the browser paints between React state updates

---

## Getting Started

Don't have a FedEx invoice handy? The dashboard includes a **"Try 3,000-row sample invoice"** button on the upload screen that loads real shipment data instantly — no file needed.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+

### Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Fcorre000/dim-risk-engine.git
cd dim-risk-engine

# Start the backend
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# In another terminal — start the frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173` and proxies API requests to `http://localhost:8000`.

### Run Tests

```bash
cd api
pytest
```

## API Reference

### `GET /health`

Returns service status and whether models are loaded.

### `POST /analyze`

Upload a `.csv` or `.xlsx` FedEx invoice. Returns a JSON array of results.

**Request:** `multipart/form-data` with a `file` field

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "tracking_number": "7489...",
    "service_type": "FEDEX_GROUND",
    "weight_lbs": 12.0,
    "dim_length": 24, "dim_width": 18, "dim_height": 12,
    "zone": "05",
    "shipment_date": "2024-01-15",
    "dim_flag_probability": 0.8231,
    "actual_net_charge": 42.50,
    "predicted_net_charge": 35.12,
    "predicted_net_charge_low": 30.55,
    "predicted_net_charge_high": 47.82,
    "dim_anomaly": null,
    "dim_confidence": null,
    "cost_anomaly": "Review",
    "cost_confidence": "High"
  }
]
```

### `POST /analyze/stream`

Same input as `/analyze`, but returns **NDJSON** for streaming consumption. First line is metadata, subsequent lines are individual shipment results.

### `GET /demo/stream`

Streams results for the built-in 3,000-row sample invoice — no file upload needed. Response format is identical to `/analyze/stream`. Powers the "Try 3,000-row sample invoice" button in the dashboard.

---

## Deployment

The app deploys to [Render](https://render.com) via the included `render.yaml`:

- **dim-risk-api** — Python web service (FastAPI)
- **dim-risk-frontend** — Static site (Vite build output)

Set `VITE_API_URL` on the frontend service to point to the API URL, and `CORS_ORIGINS` on the API service to the frontend URL.

## Changelog

### 2026-04-09 — Cold start UX + keep-alive
- First-time visitors after server inactivity now see a **"Server warming up"** banner instead of a silent spinner — disappears automatically once the server responds
- Added UptimeRobot keep-alive ping on `/health` every 5 minutes to prevent Render free-tier spin-down in the first place

### 2026-04-09 — Rate limiting and file size cap
- `POST /analyze` and `POST /analyze/stream` now enforce a **50 MB file size limit** — returns HTTP 413 if exceeded
- Both endpoints enforce a **sliding-window rate limit of 10 requests/minute per IP** — returns HTTP 429 if exceeded
- `/demo/stream` is excluded (reads a local file server-side, no upload)

### 2026-04-07 — Confidence intervals on anomaly flags
- Each shipment now includes a **90% prediction interval** (`predicted_net_charge_low` / `predicted_net_charge_high`) derived from calibrated log-space residual quantiles
- DIM anomaly badges show model confidence percentage (e.g. "Unexpected 87%") — higher % = stronger dispute case
- Cost anomaly threshold changed from `actual > predicted × 1.25` to `actual > predicted_high` (upper bound of the prediction interval) — more statistically grounded
- Recoverable estimate is now conservative: `actual − predicted_high` instead of `actual − predicted`
- Anomalies table gains a sortable **Confidence** column (default sort)
- New `dim_confidence` and `cost_confidence` fields in every API response row

### 2026-04-05 — Sample invoice test button
- Added **"Try 3,000-row sample invoice"** button to the upload screen — loads real shipment data without requiring a file upload
- Backend serves the sample via `GET /demo/stream` reading `api/sample_invoice.csv` server-side (avoids broken blob-fetch on the static site deploy)

### 2026-04-03 — Streaming progress bar
- Upload progress bar now fills proportionally for both CSV and XLSX files (XLSX row count via openpyxl `read_only` mode)
- Falls back to indeterminate shimmer when row count is unavailable
- Live KPI counters (DIM rate, dispute candidates, recoverable $) update incrementally during streaming without full recompute

### 2026-04-04 — Real shipment fields
- Removed fake placeholder functions (`deriveDims`, `deriveWeight`, `deriveZone`, `deriveService`, `deriveMonth`) that generated synthetic data from tracking number hashes
- All display fields (dimensions, weight, zone, service type, shipment date) now come from actual invoice columns parsed by the backend

### 2026-04-03 — NDJSON streaming endpoint
- Added `POST /analyze/stream` endpoint that streams results as NDJSON — one shipment per line, preceded by a `__meta__` row with total count
- Frontend reads via `ReadableStream` API for real-time rendering
